"""
Cluster Representative Selection Based on Experimental Resolution

Description
-----------
This script identifies representative structures for each structural cluster
by selecting the PDB entry (or entries) with the best experimental resolution.

The input consists of previously generated cluster assignment files
(e.g., intra-superfamily clustering results). For each superfamily and cluster,
the script queries the RCSB PDB REST API to retrieve experimental resolution
data and selects all structures sharing the minimum resolution value.

Notes
-----
If multiple PDB entries share the same best resolution within a cluster,
all are retained as co-representatives.
